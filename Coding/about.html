			<h1>About Us</h1>	
					<br>
			<p>Bound Together is your local independent bookstores, dedicated to helping you find your next favourite book.
<br><br>
We have small stores around the country. Our Wellington store is  our largest and also holds the majority of our collection of books. The Wellington story is our flagship store and has recently relocated to an old theatre. We also have cafes in all of our stores as we believe that this creates a warm and cozy atmosphere, making people want to curl up with one of our good books.
<br><br>
We believe that books are central to human entertainment and want everyone to get back into reading.
<br><br>
Our expert team, can help you to pick out a new book or you can just browse through the aisles to see what takes your fancy.
<br><br>
Run a book club? Register your book club with us and get a bulk purchase discount. We can also create a personalised list of books based on your groups favourite books and past reads.
<br><br>
Want a surprise? We have mystery books. These are books that are wrapped up in brown paper and the only information you have is the genre of the book and any content warnings in the book.
<br><br>
We have also curated a subscription box for our customers. These boxes contain a staff pick book, hot drink of the month, some snacks and some goodies from local small businesses. Each box has a theme and all items are within the theme.</p>
