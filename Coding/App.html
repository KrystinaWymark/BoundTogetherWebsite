			<h1>Bound Together App</h1>
				<br>
			<p>6 months ago we launched our app which allowed the users to create a reading list from within the database.
				<br><br>
				In the current age of instant gratification and Online profiles, we wanted to create an app that helped people get more recommendations for books and for books that they might not necessarily look at.
					<br><br>
We at Bound Together believe that the more you read the better human you become and the more knowledge you acquire.
<br><br>
The Bound Together app is being developed for those wanting to widen their book horizons.
<br><br>
The app lets you create a profile which includes the genres you like and any that you donâ€™t. From there you get to personalised recommendations on books in the genres. From there you can swipe to create your wish-list.
<br><br>
In the discover options you can choose to see books from your chosen all genres or from all but your disliked, giving you a broader range of recommendations.
<br><br>
The entire Bound Together book collection is on the app, meaning that you have a great range of books and we are adding more each month.
<br><br>
There is also a feature where you can connect with others to see what they are reading. From there you can chat with them to make new friends. The chat function also allows for you to connect with our expert team to get even more personalised recommendations.
<br><br>
The home page has been created to be like a mini feed from us at Bound Together, with store updates and new releases.
